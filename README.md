# CompliGen: LLM-Powered Enterprise Policy QA with MCP Integration

##  Objective
To build a reliable, real-time policy question-answering assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide accurate, cited responses from internal enterprise documents.

##  Problem Statement
Employees often struggle to find relevant information across large and fragmented policy documents. Traditional search tools lack contextual understanding, and generic LLMs may hallucinate or miss critical clauses. There's a need for a context-aware system that can ground LLM answers in source documents dynamically.

##  Use Cases
- HR policy questions (e.g., leave, benefits, remote work)
- Compliance and legal document clarification
- IT & security governance Q&A
- Enterprise onboarding support

##  Target Users
- HR teams
- Compliance officers
- Legal departments
- Internal helpdesk/IT support
- All enterprise employees needing policy clarity

##  Key Benefits
- Accurate, natural language responses with source citations
- Dynamic document context retrieval using MCP
- Always up-to-date with auto-retraining on policy updates

##  Status
 Project setup in progress. Core retrieval and QA module development underway.
